# 🧠 Disease Symptom Prediction using Machine Learning

This project involves predicting diseases based on reported symptoms using supervised machine learning models. It aims to assist in early diagnosis by analyzing common symptom patterns.

## 📌 Problem Definition

Given a list of symptoms, the goal is to predict the most likely disease from a predefined set. The dataset includes symptom-disease mappings and is preprocessed for multi-label classification.

## 📊 Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🧠 Models Applied
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Naive Bayes

Evaluation metrics:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score

## 📈 Results
The Random Forest model achieved the best results with over 90% accuracy. Feature importance and confusion matrix were also used to validate model performance.
